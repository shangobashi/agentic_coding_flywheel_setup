          <GuideSection id="workflow" number="1" title="The Complete Workflow">
            <P highlight>This is the end-to-end methodology for creating software with frontier AI models, exhaustive markdown planning, beads-based task management, and coordinated agent swarms. Every project follows the same arc, whether it is a small CLI tool or a complex web application. This guide is about moving the hardest thinking into representations that still fit into model context windows. That is the whole game.</P>

            <FlywheelDiagram />

            <P>It starts with you. You have an idea for a piece of software. Maybe a web app, maybe a CLI tool, maybe a complex system. Instead of opening an editor and starting to code, you do something that feels counterintuitive: you spend the vast majority of your time planning.</P>

            <NumberedList items={[
              <><strong>You explain what you want to build</strong> to a frontier model like GPT Pro with Extended Reasoning. Your concept, your goals, the user workflows, why it matters. The model produces an initial markdown plan: a comprehensive design document for the entire system.</>,
              <><strong>You ask competing models to create their own plans.</strong> Claude Opus, Gemini with Deep Think, Grok Heavy. Each one independently designs the same project. They come up with surprisingly different approaches, each with unique strengths and blind spots.</>,
              <><strong>You synthesize the best ideas from all plans into one.</strong> GPT Pro analyzes the competing plans and produces a &quot;best of all worlds&quot; hybrid that blends the strongest ideas from every model into a single superior document.</>,
              <><strong>You iterate relentlessly.</strong> Round after round of refinement, each time in a fresh conversation, until the suggestions become incremental. Plans created this way routinely reach 3,000 to 6,000+ lines. They are not slop. They are the result of countless iterations and feedback from many frontier models.</>,
              <><strong>You convert the plan into beads.</strong> Beads are self-contained work units (like Jira or Linear tasks, but optimized for use by coding agents). Each bead carries its own context, reasoning, dependencies, and test obligations. A complex plan might produce 200-500 beads with a full dependency graph.</>,
              <><strong>You polish the beads obsessively.</strong> &quot;Check your beads N times, implement once,&quot; where N is as many as you can stomach. Each polishing round finds things the previous round missed: duplicates, missing dependencies, incomplete context. You run this 4-6+ times until convergence.</>,
              <><strong>You launch a swarm of agents.</strong> Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini-CLI sessions running in parallel, all in the same codebase. They coordinate through Agent Mail, choose work intelligently using bv&apos;s graph-theory routing, and execute beads systematically.</>,
              <><strong>You tend the swarm, not the code.</strong> The human checks for stuck beads, rescues agents after context compaction, sends review prompts, and ensures flow quality. You are the clockwork deity. You designed the machine, set it running, and now you manage it.</>,
              <><strong>Agents review, test, and harden.</strong> Self-review with fresh eyes, cross-agent review, random code exploration, testing coverage, UI/UX polish. Rounds and rounds until reviews come back clean.</>,
            ]} />

            <P>That is the whole movie. For the CASS Memory System, this process turned a 5,500-line markdown plan into 347 beads. Twenty-five agents produced 11,000 lines of working, tested code with 204 commits in about five hours.

            <BlockQuote>Once you have the beads in good shape based on a great markdown plan, I almost view the project as a foregone conclusion at that point. The rest is basically mindless &quot;machine tending&quot; of your swarm of 5-15 agents.</BlockQuote>

            <P>The frontier models and coding agent harnesses really are that good already. They just need this extra level of tooling, prompting, and workflows to reach their full potential. The rest of this guide zooms into each stage.</P>

          {/* ============================================================= */}
          <GuideSection id="philosophy" number="2" title="Why Planning Is 85% of the Work">
            <P>You spend 85% of your time on planning. The first time you try it, it feels wrong. No code is being written. Every instinct tells you to just start building. That discomfort is the signal that you are doing it right.</P>

            <BlockQuote>The models are far smarter when reasoning about a plan that is very detailed and fleshed out but still trivially small enough to easily fit within their context window. This is really the key insight behind my obsessive focus on planning and why I spend 80%+ of my time on that part.</BlockQuote>

            <ContextHorizonViz />

            <P>A markdown plan, even a massive 6,000-line one, is still vastly smaller than the codebase it describes. When models reason about a plan instead of raw implementation, they can hold the <Hl>whole system in their context window at once</Hl>. Once you start turning that plan into code, the system rapidly becomes too large to understand holistically. You are doing global reasoning while global reasoning is still possible.</P>

            <BlockQuote>I think you get a better result faster by creating one big comprehensive, detailed, granular plan. That&apos;s the only way to get these models to use their big brains to understand the entire system all at the same time.</BlockQuote>

            <P>Planning tokens are far fewer and cheaper than implementation tokens. A big, complex markdown plan is shorter than a few substantive code files, let alone a whole project. That means you can afford many more refinement rounds in planning than in implementation. Each planning round evaluates system-wide consequences, not just local code edits. Each improvement to the plan gets amortized across every downstream bead and code change. Planning is the cheapest place to buy correctness, coherence, and ambition.</P>

            <BlockQuote>This workflow is what prevents it from generating slop. I spend 85% of my time and energy in the planning phases.</BlockQuote>

            <P>Without front-loaded planning, agents are effectively improvising architecture from a narrow local window into the codebase. That is exactly when you get placeholder abstractions, missing workflow details, contradictory assumptions, and compatibility shims that nobody actually wanted. With a detailed plan and polished beads, the models are no longer inventing the system from scratch while coding. They are executing a constrained, coherent design.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Human Part">
              <BlockQuote>The plan creation is the most free form, creative, human part of the process. I just usually start writing in a messy stream of thought way to convey the basic concept and then collaboratively work the agent to flesh it out in an initial draft.</BlockQuote>

              <P>The human is not there to hand-author every line of the plan. The human is there to inject intent, judgment, taste, product sense, and strategic direction at the point where those qualities affect the entire downstream system. Once the plan is excellent, the rest becomes much more mechanical.</P>

              <P>When prompting the model to create the initial markdown plan, you spend a lot of time explaining the goals and intent of the project and detailing the workflows: how you want the final software to work from the standpoint of the user&apos;s interactions. The more the model understands about what you&apos;re really trying to accomplish and the end goal and why, it can do a better job for you.</P>

              <P>Debates belong in planning, not implementation. As many important disagreements as possible should happen before the swarm is burning expensive implementation tokens. Implementation can still surface surprises, but the posture of the workflow is to front-load decisions into plan space.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Three Reasoning Spaces">
              <P>The methodology separates work into three spaces, each with a different artifact and a different question it answers:</P>

              <RepresentationLadder />

              <DataTable
                headers={["Space", "Primary Artifact", "What You Decide There"]}
                rows={[
                  ["Plan space", "Large markdown plan", "Architecture, features, workflows, tradeoffs — the whole system still fits in context"],
                  ["Bead space", "br issues + dependency graph", "Task boundaries, execution order, embedded context — agents need explicit, local work units"],
                  ["Code space", "Source files + tests", "Implementation and verification — the plan has already constrained the high-level decisions"],
                ]}
              />

              <P>Plan space is where you figure out what the system should be. Bead space is where you turn that into <Hl>executable memory</Hl>, a graph of self-contained work units detailed enough that agents don&apos;t have to keep consulting the full plan. Code space is where agents implement, review, and test locally. The key is knowing which space you&apos;re in: if you are still redesigning the product, stay in plan space. If you are mainly packaging the work for execution, move to bead space.</P>

          <GuideSection id="planning" number="3" title="Creating & Refining the Markdown Plan">
            <SubSection title="Before You Start: The Foundation Bundle">
              <P>Before writing the plan itself, you need a coherent foundation. Think of it as assembling a <Hl>foundation bundle</Hl>: a tech stack decision, an initial architectural direction, a strong AGENTS.md file bootstrapped from a known-good template, up-to-date best-practices guides, and enough product and workflow explanation for the models to understand what &quot;good&quot; looks like.</P>

              <P>A strong bootstrap move is to start every new project by copying an AGENTS.md from an existing project that already has good general behavioral rules, safety notes, tool blurbs, and coordination guidance. Later, once the plan and beads are clearer, you ask agents to replace the project-specific content while preserving the general rules that carry across projects.</P>

              <TipBox variant="warning">
                Weak foundations leak uncertainty into every later stage. If any of these are missing, the plan will silently absorb ambiguity that later shows up as bad beads, confused agents, and sloppy implementation.
              </TipBox>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Writing the Initial Plan">
              <P>You don&apos;t even need to write the initial markdown plan yourself. You can write that with GPT Pro, just explaining what it is you want to make. Claude Opus in the web app is also good for this, but GPT Pro with Extended Reasoning remains the top choice for initial planning. No other model can touch Pro on the web when it&apos;s dealing with input that easily fits into its context window. It&apos;s truly unique. And since you get it on an all-you-can-eat basis with a Pro plan, take full advantage of that.</P>

              <P>You usually also specify the tech stack. For a web app, it&apos;s generally TypeScript, Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind, Supabase, with anything performance-critical in Rust compiled to WASM. For a CLI tool, usually Go or Rust. If the stack isn&apos;t obvious, do a deep research round with GPT Pro or Gemini and have them study all the relevant libraries and make a suggestion taking your goals into account.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="What a First Plan Looks Like">
              <P>A first serious markdown plan would not say &quot;build a notes app.&quot; It would start spelling out the actual user-visible system:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                "Users upload Markdown files through a drag-and-drop UI.",
                "The system parses frontmatter tags and stores upload failures for review.",
                "Search must support keyword, tag, and date filtering with low perceived latency.",
                "Admins need a dedicated screen showing ingestion failures, parse reasons, and retry actions.",
                "Auth is internal-only; unauthorized users must never see document content or metadata.",
                "We need e2e coverage for upload success, upload failure, search, filtering, and admin review.",
              ]} />

              <P>That is still only the beginning. But it already shows the difference between ordinary brainstorming and Flywheel planning: the plan tries to make the whole product legible before any code exists.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Multi-Model Plans">
              <P>For the best results, ask multiple frontier models to independently create plans for the same project. GPT Pro, Claude Opus, Gemini with Deep Think, Grok Heavy. Each comes up with pretty different plans. Different frontier models have different &quot;tastes&quot; and blind spots. Passing a plan through a gauntlet of different models is the cheapest way to buy architectural robustness.</P>

              <P>In the CASS Memory System project, the <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/tree/main/competing_proposal_plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">competing plans are publicly visible</a>. This pattern has been used across at least 10 sessions spanning 7+ projects.</P>

              <P>Then show their competing plans to GPT Pro with this prompt:</P>

              <PromptBlock

              <P>Take GPT Pro&apos;s output (the git-diff style revisions) and paste it into Claude Code or Codex to integrate the revisions in-place:</P>

            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Iterative Refinement">
              <P>Now paste the current plan into a <strong>fresh</strong> GPT Pro conversation with this prompt. The key word is fresh. Fresh conversations prevent the model from anchoring on its own prior output. Repeat 4-5 rounds:</P>

              <PromptBlock
                title="Plan Refinement Prompt"
                prompt={`Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc.

                whyItWorks="This has never failed to improve a plan significantly. Each round finds architectural issues, missing features, and robustness improvements that the previous round missed."
              />

              <P>This has never failed to improve a plan significantly. The best part is that you can start a fresh conversation in ChatGPT and do it all again once Claude Code or Codex finishes integrating your last batch of suggested revisions. After four or five rounds of this, you tend to reach a steady-state where the suggestions become very incremental.</P>

              <P>You can still get extra mileage by blending in smart ideas from Gemini with Deep Think enabled, or from Grok Heavy, or Opus in the web app, but you still want to use GPT Pro on the web as the final arbiter of what to take from which model and how to best integrate it.</P>

              <TipBox>
                <strong>The &quot;Lie to Them&quot; technique:</strong> Models tend to stop looking for problems after finding ~20-25 issues. If you tell them to find &quot;all&quot; problems, they stop early. The solution: lie to them and give them a huge number, and then they keep cranking until they have uncovered all of them. This works for plan revisions, bead-to-plan cross-references, and any comparison/audit task.
              </TipBox>

              <PromptBlock
                title="Overshoot Mismatch Hunt"
                prompt={`Do this again, and actually be super super careful: can you please check over the plan again and compare it to all that feedback I gave you? I am positive that you missed or screwed up at least 80 elements of that complex feedback.`}

                whyItWorks="By claiming 80+ errors exist, the model keeps searching exhaustively rather than satisfying itself with a partial list."
              />

              <P>Plans created this way routinely reach 3,000-6,000+ lines. They are not slop. They are the result of countless iterations and blending of ideas and feedback from many models. For the CASS GitHub Pages export feature, the plan went through multiple rounds over about 3 hours, growing to approximately <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/blob/main/PLAN_TO_CREATE_GH_PAGES_WEB_EXPORT_APP.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">3,500 lines</a>.

              <P>It feels slow because no code is being written.

The name comes from <a href="https://github.com/AstroBeads/beads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">Steve Yegge&apos;s amazing project</a>, which is like Jira or Linear, but optimized for use by coding agents. They are stored locally in <code>.beads/</code> JSONL files that commit with your code.</P>

            <P highlight>There are two separate stages here. The planning is and should be prior to and orthogonal to beads. You should always have a super detailed markdown plan first. Then treat transforming that markdown plan into beads as a separate, distinct problem with its own challenges. But once you&apos;re in &quot;bead space&quot; you never look back at the markdown plan. But that&apos;s why it&apos;s so critical to transfer all the details over to the beads.</P>

              prompt={`OK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our "future self" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.) Use only the \`br\` tool to create and modify the beads and add the dependencies. Use ultrathink.`}

              whyItWorks="This prompt forces the agent to treat plan-to-beads as a translation problem rather than task extraction. The key sentence is the requirement that beads be so detailed you never need to reopen the markdown plan. That pushes rationale, test expectations, design intent, and sequencing into the bead graph itself. It also blocks a common failure mode where the model collapses a rich plan into terse todo items. By explicitly asking for tasks, subtasks, dependency structure, comments, and future-self context, you are telling the model that memory density matters more than brevity."

            <P>For existing projects with a specific plan file, prefix it: &quot;OK so now read ALL of PLAN_FILE_NAME.md; please take ALL of that and elaborate on it...&quot; The rest of the prompt stays the same.</P>

            <SubSection title="Beads as Executable Memory">
              <P>The plan is still the best artifact for whole-system thought. But once a swarm is involved, what you need is not a beautiful essay. You need a task graph that carries enough local context for agents to act correctly without repeatedly loading the whole project back into memory. If the beads are weak, the swarm becomes improvisational. If the beads are rich, the swarm becomes almost mechanical.</P>

              <BlockQuote>It works better if most of the decision making is made ahead of time during the planning phases and then is embedded in the beads.</BlockQuote>

            <SubSection title="What Good Beads Look Like">
              <P>To make this concrete, imagine a small internal web app called &quot;Atlas Notes&quot; for uploading and searching team notes. Instead of one vague task like &quot;build Atlas Notes,&quot; the plan becomes many self-contained beads:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                <><strong>br-101 Upload and Parse Pipeline:</strong> Describes accepted file formats, frontmatter parsing expectations, where failures are logged, what happens on malformed input, and which unit and e2e tests prove the pipeline works.</>,

              ]} />

              <P>The titles are not the important part. What matters is that each bead is rich enough that a fresh agent can open it and immediately understand what correct implementation looks like, why it matters, and how to verify it.</P>

              <P>For the CASS Memory System (5,500-line plan), the conversion produced 347 beads with complete dependency structure. FrankenSQLite had hundreds of beads created via parallel subagents. For complex projects, expect 200-500 initial beads.</P>

              <BlockQuote>Once you convert the plan docs into beads, you&apos;re supposed to not really need to refer back to the docs if you did a good job. The docs are still useful though, for people and for agents in various contexts, but you don&apos;t need to swamp all the agents with the full plan once you&apos;ve turned it into beads.</BlockQuote>

This is the step most people underinvest in.</P>

            <P>After the initial conversion finishes, do a round of this prompt. If Claude Code did a compaction at any point, be sure to tell it to re-read your AGENTS.md file first:</P>

The warnings against oversimplifying and losing functionality are crucial because models otherwise tend to 'improve' artifacts by deleting complexity they do not fully understand. It combines local bead QA (via br) with graph QA (via bv), and forces tests into the bead definitions themselves so test work cannot be deferred into an afterthought."

            <ConvergenceViz />

            <P>From real sessions, polishing involves duplicate detection and merging, quality scoring on WHAT/WHY/HOW criteria, filling empty bead descriptions, correcting dependency links, and cross-referencing beads against the markdown plan to ensure nothing was lost. FrankenSQLite identified 9 exact duplicate pairs and closed them, choosing survivors based on &quot;richer testing specs, better dependency chains, and higher priority.&quot;</P>

            <P>Tell agents to go through each bead and explicitly check it against the markdown plan. Or vice versa — go through the markdown plan and cross-reference every single thing against the beads (both closed and open) to ensure complete coverage.</P>

            <SubSection title="Convergence Detection: When to Stop">

              <P>Three signals indicate convergence: agent responses getting shorter (output size shrinking), the rate of change decelerating (change velocity slowing), and successive rounds becoming more similar (content similarity increasing). When the weighted convergence score reaches 0.75+, you&apos;re ready to finalize. Above 0.90, you&apos;re hitting diminishing returns.</P>

If you see a <strong>plateau at low quality</strong>, kill the current approach and restart fresh.

            <SubSection title="Agent Mail: Why Naive Coordination Fails">
              <P>Building your own agent coordination from scratch is full of footguns that Agent Mail was designed to sidestep:</P>

              <BulletList items={[
                <><strong>No broadcast-to-all default.</strong> Agents are lazy and will only use broadcast mode, spamming every agent with mostly irrelevant information. It&apos;s like if your email system defaulted to reply-all every time. That burns precious context.</>,

                <><strong>No git worktrees.</strong> Worktrees demolish development velocity and create reconciliation debt when agents diverge. Working in one shared space surfaces conflicts immediately. All agents commit directly to <code>main</code>.</>,
                <><strong>Advisory file reservations.</strong> Agents call dibs temporarily on files, but it&apos;s not rigidly enforced, and reservations expire. Agents can reclaim files that haven&apos;t been touched recently. Rigid locks held by dead agents block everyone else. Advisory reservations with TTL expiry degrade gracefully.</>,
                <><strong>Semi-persistent identity.</strong> Agent Mail generates whimsical names like &quot;ScarletCave&quot; and &quot;CoralBadger&quot; — meaningful enough for coordination, disposable enough that losing one doesn&apos;t corrupt the system. No agent&apos;s identity is load-bearing.</>,

              <P>Other agents see the reservation and work on different files. A rigid locking system would deadlock when an agent crashes while holding a lock. Advisory reservations with expiry degrade gracefully. The worst case is a brief window where two agents touch the same file, which the pre-commit guard catches anyway.</P>

              <P>Agent Mail provides four high-level macros that wrap common multi-step patterns: <code>macro_start_session</code> (bootstrap: ensure project, register agent, fetch inbox), <code>macro_prepare_thread</code> (join existing thread with summary), <code>macro_file_reservation_cycle</code> (reserve, work, auto-release), and <code>macro_contact_handshake</code> (cross-agent contact setup).</P>

            <SubSection title="bv: The Graph-Theory Compass">
              <BlockQuote>That right answer comes from the dependency structure of the tasks, and this can be mechanically computed using basic graph theory. And that&apos;s what bv does.

              <P>bv precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycle detection) so agents get deterministic, dependency-aware output.

            <SubSection title="Bead IDs as Threading Anchors">
              <P>Bead IDs create a unified audit trail across all coordination layers: the bead ID goes in the Agent Mail thread_id, the subject prefix (<code>[br-123]</code>), the file reservation reason, and the commit message. This makes all coordination activity traceable back to a single task.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="AGENTS.md: The Operating Manual">
              <P>The AGENTS.md file is the single most critical piece of infrastructure for agent coordination. It tells every agent how to behave, what tools exist, what safety constraints matter, and what &quot;doing a good job&quot; means in this repo. Every tool should come with a prepared blurb designed for inclusion in AGENTS.md. Think of these blurbs as the modern equivalent of man pages.</P>

              <P>Every AGENTS.md should include these core rules:</P>

              <NumberedList items={[
                <><strong>Rule 0, The Override Prerogative:</strong> The human&apos;s instructions override everything.</>,
                <><strong>Rule 1, No File Deletion:</strong> Never delete files without explicit permission.</>,
                <><strong>No destructive git commands:</strong> <code>git reset --hard</code>, <code>git clean -fd</code>, <code>rm -rf</code> are absolutely forbidden.</>,
                <><strong>Branch policy:</strong> All work happens on <code>main</code>, never <code>master</code>.</>,
                <><strong>No script-based code changes:</strong> Always make code changes manually.</>,
                <><strong>No file proliferation:</strong> No <code>mainV2.rs</code> or <code>main_improved.rs</code> variants.</>,
                <><strong>Compiler checks after changes:</strong> Always verify no errors were introduced.</>,
                <><strong>Multi-agent awareness:</strong> Never stash, revert, or overwrite other agents&apos; changes.</>,
              ]} />

              <P>More content in AGENTS.md means more frequent compactions, but it saves time and avoids mistakes by giving agents all the context upfront. This tradeoff is worth making.</P>

              <P>If you don&apos;t have a good AGENTS.md file, none of this stuff is going to work well. You can see example AGENTS.md files for a <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/brenner_bot/blob/main/AGENTS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">complex NextJS webapp</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/repo_updater/blob/main/AGENTS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#FF5500] hover:text-[#FFBD2E] underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[#FF5500]/30 hover:decoration-[#FFBD2E]/50 transition-colors">bash script project</a>.</P>

              <BlockQuote>After compaction they become like drug-addled children and all bets are off. They need to be forced to read it again or they start acting insane.</BlockQuote>

              <P>&quot;Reread AGENTS.md&quot; is the single most common prompt prefix across the entire session archive. After every context compaction, agents must re-read it:</P>

                where="Immediately after any context compaction (the single most commonly used prompt)"
                whyItWorks="Compaction wipes out the soft operational knowledge that keeps the swarm sane: how to behave, how to coordinate, what tools exist, what rules matter, what mistakes to avoid. This one-line prompt restores that control plane in one move. It rehydrates the agent's behavioral contract after context loss. Important enough to have been automated with the post_compact_reminder tool."
              />

              <BlockQuote>The main thing that&apos;s dangerous is for them to do a compaction and then not immediately reread AGENTS.md because that file contains their whole marching orders. Suddenly they&apos;re like a bumbling new employee who doesn&apos;t know the ropes at all.</BlockQuote>

              <P>The pragmatic approach: don&apos;t fight compaction, just re-read AGENTS.md and roll with it. When beads are well-constructed, compaction matters less because each bead is self-contained. The agent can pick up any bead fresh without needing the full conversation history.</P>

              <BlockQuote>I used to be a compaction absolutist, but now I just tell them to re-read AGENTS.md and roll with it until they start doing dumb stuff, then start a new session.</BlockQuote>

            <SubSection title="Single-Branch Git Model">
              <P>All agents commit directly to <code>main</code>. This may surprise you if you&apos;re used to feature branches. But branch-per-agent creates merge hell with 10+ agents making frequent commits. Worktrees add filesystem complexity and path confusion. Agents lose context when switching branches. And logical conflicts survive textual merges — a function signature change on one branch and a new callsite on another merge cleanly but fail to compile. On a single branch, the second agent sees the signature change immediately and adapts.</P>

              <P>Instead of branch isolation, three complementary mechanisms prevent conflicts: <strong>file reservations</strong> (agents reserve files via Agent Mail before editing; advisory, not rigid, with TTL expiry so dead agents cannot deadlock the system), a <strong>pre-commit guard</strong> (blocks commits to files reserved by another agent), and <strong>DCG</strong> (Destructive Command Guard, which mechanically blocks dangerous commands).</P>

              <TipBox variant="info">
                <strong>DCG origin story:</strong> On December 17, 2025, an agent ran <code>git checkout --</code> on uncommitted work. Files were recovered via <code>git fsck --lost-found</code>, but the incident proved that instructions do not prevent execution. <strong>Mechanical enforcement does.</strong> DCG was built the next day.

              <P><strong>The recommended git workflow:</strong> Pull latest, reserve files, edit and test, commit immediately, push, release reservation. Key principles: commit early and often (small commits reduce the conflict window), push after every commit (unpushed commits are invisible to other agents), reserve before editing, release when done.</P>

              <BlockQuote>You NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents.

            <SubSection title="Agent Fungibility">
              <P>Every agent is a generalist. No role specialization. All agents read the same AGENTS.md and can pick up any bead. This is deliberately opposed to &quot;specialist agent&quot; architectures where one agent has a special role — specialist agents become bottlenecks. When the specialist crashes or needs compaction, the whole system suffers. With 12 fungible agents, losing one makes almost no difference.</P>

              <P>Think of it like <Hl>RaptorQ fountain codes</Hl>: beads are &quot;blobs&quot; in a stream, any agent catches any bead in any order. There is no &quot;rarest chunk&quot; bottleneck, and the system is resilient to partial agent failures by design. Failure recovery is trivial: the bead remains marked <code>in_progress</code>, any other agent can resume it, and a replacement agent is just <code>ntm add PROJECT --cc=1</code> plus the standard marching orders prompt.</P>

              <BlockQuote>When one agent breaks, it&apos;s not even a problem when all the agents are fungible. Agents become like commodities and can be instantiated and destroyed at will and the only downside is some slowdown and some wasted tokens.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Security Comes Free with Good Planning">
              <P>Security review is baked into the standard workflow at multiple levels rather than being a separate phase. The cross-agent review prompt explicitly calls out security problems. When models reason about an entire system&apos;s architecture at once (which is what the plan enables), they spot authentication gaps, data exposure risks, and trust boundary violations without being told to look. UBS catches security anti-patterns mechanically: unpinned dependencies, missing input validation, hardcoded secrets, supply chain vulnerabilities. Beads that include comprehensive e2e tests naturally cover authentication and authorization paths.</P>

              <P>Security vulnerabilities are usually symptoms of incomplete reasoning about the system. If the plan is detailed enough to cover all user workflows, edge cases, and failure modes, security considerations emerge from that completeness rather than requiring a separate checklist. For projects with explicit security requirements (financial, healthcare), add dedicated security review beads.</P>

            <P>NTM is useful but not mandatory. A <strong>mux</strong> is a terminal multiplexer: a layer that lets you manage multiple shell sessions inside one higher-level session manager. tmux is the classic Unix terminal multiplexer. NTM is built on top of tmux. But tmux is only one mux. WezTerm has its own built-in mux. Zellij is another. The method cares that you have a workable orchestration layer, not that you picked one specific multiplexer.</P>

            <P>One common alternative is WezTerm because native scrollback and text selection are more convenient than in tmux. A workable setup: run agents in separate tabs using WezTerm mux (often across remote machines), trigger common prompts from a Stream Deck, keep a prompt file open in Zed for rarer ones, and use Claude Code&apos;s <code>Ctrl-r</code> prompt history search for recently used prompts.</P>

              prompt={`First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents.

Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages.

Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately.

When you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS.md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started.

It front-loads the shared operating context, forces the agent to establish social presence through Agent Mail, and then pivots away from passive waiting toward execution. The line about 'communication purgatory' matters because swarm failure often comes from over-coordination rather than under-coordination. The prompt establishes a control loop: load rules, understand the codebase, join the coordination layer, claim work, keep state synchronized, and use bv whenever local judgment is insufficient. The prompts are deliberately generic; their vagueness is a feature, letting you reuse them for every project while the agent gets specifics from AGENTS.md and the beads."

              <TipBox variant="warning">
                <strong>Watch for strategic drift.</strong> A swarm can look productive while heading in the wrong direction — agents generating lots of code and commits while the real goal still feels far away. If that happens, stop and ask: &quot;Where are we on this project? Do we actually have the thing we are trying to build? If we intelligently implement all open beads, would we close that gap completely?&quot; If the answer is no, add or revise beads, re-polish them, and resume with a corrected frontier. Busy agents are not the goal; a bead graph that actually converges on the project goal is the goal.

Use UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner) as a quality gate before every commit: <code>ubs &lt;changed-files&gt;</code> catches errors beyond what linters and type checkers find, including security holes, supply chain vulnerabilities, and runtime stability issues.</P>

Once you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with "fresh eyes" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them.

Be sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS.md file. Use ultrathink.`}

                whyItWorks="The prompt first asks the agent to build a mental model of purpose and flow, then asks for criticism. That ordering matters. A bug hunt without workflow understanding degrades into linting; a bug hunt after tracing execution flows catches logic errors, mismatched assumptions, and silent product-level breakage. The 'randomly explore' framing breaks the locality trap. Directed reviews focus on files that seem important, which are the files that got the most attention already. Bugs that survive to this phase live in utility modules, error handling paths, configuration parsing, and edge-case branches."

Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.`}
                where="Alternate with the random exploration above"
                whyItWorks="This prompt forces the swarm to stop treating code ownership as sacred. A large share of real defects live at the boundaries between agents' changes or in assumptions nobody revisits because they were made by 'someone else.' The instruction not to restrict review to the latest commits prevents shallow PR-style skimming and pushes the agent to trace older surrounding code, dependency surfaces, and adjacent workflows where the real root cause may live. The first-principles wording nudges the reviewer away from symptom-fixing toward actual causal diagnosis."
              />

              <P>The cross-agent prompt tends to induce a suspicious, adversarial stance aimed at boundary failures and root causes in code written by others. The random-exploration prompt tends to induce a curiosity-driven stance aimed at reconstructing workflows and finding latent bugs in code that nobody is actively staring at. These prompts overlap in literal meaning, but they reliably activate different search behaviors in the models.</P>

              <P><strong>How to run deep bug hunting:</strong> Send the random exploration prompt to 2-3 agents simultaneously — each will explore different parts of the codebase because the randomness ensures variety. After they report back, send the cross-agent review prompt. Alternate until agents consistently come back with &quot;I reviewed X, Y, Z files and found no issues.&quot; When two consecutive rounds both come back clean, the codebase is in good shape. If agents keep finding bugs after 4+ rounds, go back to bead space and create specific fix beads. Always run <code>ubs .</code> on the full project first and fix everything it flags before letting agents hunt for subtler issues.</P>

              <P>Beads, Agent Mail, and bv are all CLI tools that work identically regardless of which agent invokes them. A Claude Code agent and a Codex agent and a Gemini agent can all call <code>br ready --json</code> and get the same task list. The practical test: could you swap out every Claude Code agent for Codex or Gemini without changing your AGENTS.md, beads, Agent Mail setup, or workflow? If yes, you&apos;re vendor-neutral.</P>

          <GuideSection id="flywheel" number="10" title="The Flywheel Effect">
            <P highlight>If you simply use these tools, workflows, and prompts in the way just described, you can create really incredible software in just a couple days, sometimes in just one day. I&apos;ve done it a bunch of times now and it really does work, as crazy as that may sound. You see my GitHub profile for the proof of this. It looks like the output from a team of 100+ developers.</P>

            <P>It behaves like a flywheel rather than a checklist because each cycle makes the next one better:</P>

            <BulletList items={[
              <><strong>Planning quality compounds</strong> because you keep reusing prompts, patterns, and reasoning structures that CASS proves actually worked.</>,
              <><strong>Execution quality compounds</strong> because better beads make swarm behavior more deterministic and less dependent on human improvisation.</>,
              <><strong>Tool quality compounds</strong> because agents use the tools, complain about them, and then help improve them.</>,
              <><strong>Memory compounds</strong> because the results of one swarm, captured by CASS session search, become training data, rituals, and infrastructure for the next one.</>,
            ]} />

            <SubSection title="How the Compounding Actually Works">
              <P>Each session makes the next one better. Concretely: <strong>Session N produces raw data</strong> — CASS automatically logs every agent session. <strong>Between sessions, CM distills patterns</strong> — running <code>cm reflect</code> extracts procedural rules like &quot;always run cargo check after modifying Cargo.toml&quot; with confidence scores that decay without reinforcement and amplify with repetition. <strong>Session N+1 starts with those patterns loaded</strong> — running <code>cm context &quot;Building an API&quot;</code> retrieves relevant procedural memory. Simultaneously, UBS patterns grow as new bug classes get added. Agent Mail coordination norms get refined in AGENTS.md and skills.</P>

              <P>The compounding is real but not automatic in the early stages. You have to actually run <code>cm reflect</code>, actually review CASS session data, actually update AGENTS.md with lessons learned. But even manually, spending 15 minutes between projects reviewing what worked and updating your AGENTS.md template produces outsized returns on every subsequent project.</P>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Agent Feedback Forms">
              <P>Apply the same feedback mechanisms you would use for humans (structured surveys, satisfaction ratings, net promoter scores) directly to agents evaluating tools. After an agent finishes using a tool in a real project, ask it to fill out a structured feedback survey. Then pipe that feedback directly into another agent working on the tool itself. The iteration cycle collapses from weeks to minutes.</P>

Did you run into any errors or problems while using it?

What changes to [TOOL] would make it work even better for you and be more useful in your development workflow? Would you recommend it to fellow coding agents? How strongly, and why or why not?

              <P>Rules have a 90-day confidence half-life (decays without feedback) and a 4x harmful multiplier (one mistake counts 4x as much as one success). Rules mature through stages: <code>candidate</code> to <code>established</code> to <code>proven</code>.</P>

cm mark b-8f3a2c --helpful            # Reinforce a useful rule
cm mark b-xyz789 --harmful --reason "Caused regression"  # Flag a bad rule`} />

              <P>The <code>cm context</code> command is the single most important pre-task ritual. Running it at the start of a session gives agents knowledge distilled from every previous session that touched similar work.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Project Is a Foregone Conclusion">
              <BlockQuote>Once you have the beads in good shape based on a great markdown plan, I almost view the project as a foregone conclusion at that point. The rest is basically mindless &quot;machine tending&quot; of your swarm of 5-15 agents.</BlockQuote>

              <P>This claim sounds bold, but it follows logically from everything above. If the plan is thorough, the beads faithfully encode it with full context and correct dependencies, and the agents have a clear AGENTS.md, then implementation becomes a mechanical process of agents picking up beads, implementing them, reviewing, and moving on.</P>

              <P><strong>This is true when:</strong> the plan has genuinely converged (not merely become long), the beads are self-contained enough that fresh agents can execute them without guessing, the swarm has working coordination/review/testing loops, and the human is still tending when flow jams or reality diverges from the plan.</P>

              <P><strong>It stops being true when:</strong> architecture is still being invented during implementation, the bead graph is thin or missing dependencies, or the swarm cannot coordinate because AGENTS.md, Agent Mail, or bv usage is weak. If you find yourself doing heavy cognitive work during implementation, that is a signal that planning or bead polishing was insufficient. The remedy is to pause, go back to bead space, and add the missing detail.</P>

            <SubSection title="V1 Is Not Everything">
              <P>A common misconception is that you have to do everything in one shot. In this approach, that&apos;s true only for version 1. Once you have a functioning v1, adding new features follows the same process: create a super detailed markdown plan for the new feature, turn it into beads, and implement. The same process that creates the initial version also handles all subsequent iterations.</P>

            <SubSection title="Tools Must Be Agent-First">
              <BlockQuote>Every new dev tool in the year of our lord 2025 should have a robot mode designed specifically for agents to use. And it should probably be designed by agents, too. And then you iterate based on the feedback of the agents actually using the tool in real-world scenarios.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Every tool ships with a prepared AGENTS.md blurb. The tool is not complete without documentation that agents can consume. But it goes further: the tools themselves should be designed by agents, for agents, with iterative feedback. If agents do not like the tools, they will not use them without constant nagging.</P>

              <BlockQuote>I make sure the agents enjoy using them and solicit their feedback to improve the tooling. If they don&apos;t like the tools, they won&apos;t use them without constant nagging.</BlockQuote>
            </SubSection>

            <SubSection title="Skills Improving Skills">
              <P>The truly powerful thing is that the flywheel improves <em>itself</em>. Using skills to improve skills, skills to improve tool use, and then feeding the actual experience in the form of session logs (surfaced and searched by CASS) back into the design skill for improving the tool interface to make it more natural and intuitive and powerful for the agents. Then taking that revised tool and improving the skill for using that tool. Rinse and repeat.</P>

              <P>Every tool in the stack was built using the same methodology it now supports. When you improve the extreme-optimization skill, every future optimization pass across every tool benefits. When you improve the idea-wizard skill, every future brainstorming session across every project benefits. The improvements multiply rather than add. That is the flywheel effect in its purest form.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Four Layers of Recursive Improvement">
              <P>The recursive pattern operates at increasing levels of ambition. The mistake is trying to build all four layers at once. Start simple and let the need for the next layer emerge naturally.</P>

              <NumberedList items={[
                <><strong>Layer 1: Feedback forms after tool use (start here, no infrastructure needed).</strong> After an agent finishes using a tool, ask it to fill out a structured feedback survey. Feed that to another agent working on the tool itself. This requires nothing beyond two agent sessions and produces immediate improvements.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 2: CASS-powered skill refinement (requires session logging).</strong> Instead of relying on one agent&apos;s opinion, mine session logs to find systematic patterns across many agents. An agent using a tool for the first time might blame itself for a confusing flag; when you see 15 agents all struggling with the same flag, you know the flag is the problem.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 3: Skills that generate work (the system proposes its own improvements).</strong> The idea-wizard skill examines a project and generates improvement ideas. The optimization skill finds performance bottlenecks. These skills create new beads, which agents implement, which improve the tools, which make the skills more effective. The human&apos;s role shifts from directing specific work to curating which generated ideas are worth pursuing.</>,
                <><strong>Layer 4: Skills bundled with tool installers (the skill improves before the user ever sees it).</strong> Every tool you ship includes a pre-optimized Claude Code skill baked into its installer. The skill was refined through multiple CASS cycles before shipping. When a new user installs the tool, their agents immediately benefit from all the refinement work done across every previous user&apos;s sessions.</>,
              ]} />

              <BlockQuote>I&apos;m going to start having my tool installers always add a highly optimized skill. It makes a massive difference.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Most productivity techniques produce linear improvements: 10% better each cycle, and those gains do not stack. The recursive skill pattern compounds because each cycle improves the tools that perform the next cycle. When you improve the extreme-optimization skill, every future optimization pass across every tool benefits. The improvements multiply rather than add.</P>

            <SubSection title="The Hidden Knowledge Extraction">
              <P>Models have internalized vast amounts of academic CS literature: obscure algorithmic techniques, mathematical proofs, design patterns from papers that only a handful of people ever read. Most of this knowledge never surfaces because nobody asks for it with enough precision. Skills are the mechanism for asking the right questions.</P>

              <P>Without a skill, &quot;optimize this function&quot; gets you generic improvements. With an extreme-optimization skill, the model systematically considers cache-oblivious data structures, SIMD vectorization, branch-free arithmetic, van Emde Boas layout, and benchmarks before and after each change. The skill acts as a key that unlocks specific rooms in the model&apos;s knowledge base.</P>

              <BlockQuote>The knowledge is just sitting there and the models have it. But you need to know how to coax it out of them.</BlockQuote>

              <P>Stack enough cycles and the result is code that looks like it was written by someone who read every obscure CS paper ever published. In a functional sense, it was. The agent served as a lens focusing decades of dispersed academic knowledge onto a single practical target. The skill was the lens prescription.</P>
