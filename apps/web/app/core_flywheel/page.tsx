            <P highlight>The full Flywheel system has grown large enough that many people find it overwhelming on first contact. That reaction makes sense. But there is a much smaller core that already captures most of what makes the approach powerful.</P>

            <P>The larger system includes planning workflows, memory systems, prompt libraries, launch tooling, safety tooling, skills, and a lot of accumulated operational detail. You do not need to absorb all of that up front.</P>

            <P>The core loop uses just <Hl>three tools</Hl>. If you understand those three and use them together correctly, you already have the heart of the system.</P>

              <P>Good beads include: what needs to be done, relevant background, what it depends on, what counts as done, and what tests need to exist. The more explicit the bead graph is, the less improvisation the swarm has to do later.</P>

                <strong>Beads are executable memory.</strong> The markdown plan is the best artifact for whole-system thought. Beads are the plan after it has been transformed into a format optimized for distributed execution. Weak beads force improvisation. Rich beads make execution mechanical.
